# Jeremy Wu T2A2 - Marketplace Project

## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

In store retail businesses these days are finding it hard to compete with online stores, as they are more convenient and usually have cheaper pricing on their products as their running costs are lower due to not needing to pay in store run costs. Due to the increase of online retail stores, many in store retail have closed or decreased the amount of stores there, e.g. David Jones. 

In 2012, there was a retail store called GAME Australia that sold gaming products and went into administration due to online competition. This GAME AU marketplace will give GAME AU a restart into the gaming market as it is a two way marketplace which allows users to sell and buy new or second hand gaming products online. 

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

As Gumtree and Ebay are great and more popular two way marketplaces to sell or buy any new or second hand products but while doing a bit of research, there is not a two way marketplace specifically for gaming products, which makes it a great opportunity to start up that niche in the market which is targeted at gamers on a budget.  

In business in general, maximizing profit would usually create a successful business and by retail businesses moving into an online store would decrease running costs. 

Taking a business that went into administration and revamping it may not be ideal due to it might have a bad history with customers but the pros are that the brand has already been created which would save time and money as there is no need to create a brand new design or logos.
